# Fraud Risk Analytics & Anomaly Detection System

A Machine Learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using imbalance-aware modeling techniques and fraud-focused evaluation metrics.
## Project Overview

This project analyzes a highly imbalanced financial transaction dataset to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Multiple Machine Learning models were implemented and compared to build an effective fraud detection pipeline.

The project focuses on:
- Fraud detection
- Imbalanced data handling
- Model comparison
- Threshold tuning
- Precision-recall optimization

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction records with:
- PCA-transformed features (`V1` to `V28`)
- Transaction `Amount`
- Transaction `Time`
- Target variable:
  - `0` → Legitimate Transaction
  - `1` → Fraudulent Transaction

Since fraudulent transactions represent less than 1% of the dataset, handling class imbalance was one of the major challenges of the project.

## Project Workflow

1. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand transaction patterns and class imbalance.

2. Applied data preprocessing techniques including train-test split, feature scaling, and SMOTE for imbalance handling.

3. Built and compared multiple Machine Learning models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost

4. Evaluated models using fraud-focused metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix.

5. Applied threshold tuning to improve fraud detection precision and reduce false positives.

## Key Findings

- Logistic Regression achieved high recall but generated many false positives.
- Random Forest provided the best balance between fraud detection and false alarm reduction.
- Threshold tuning improved Random Forest precision from **79% to 87%**.
- XGBoost achieved strong recall but lower precision compared to Random Forest.
- Features such as `V14`, `V17`, `V12`, and `V10` showed strong fraud-related patterns.
